#9.1 How the Web Works
## Release 1

1. **Design philosophies of Linux:**
    * Free, open source
    * "By the people, for the people."
    * secure
    * reliable
    * easy to use

2. **Virtual Private Server**
    * A VPS is a virtual (not physical) machine that is a block of memory on the web. It contains software that acts as a server.

3. **Why is it a bad idea to run programs as the root user?**
    * I couldn't find much info on this (in the time that I gave myself) but it appears that other users on the sytem wouldn't have access to programs installed as the root user.
