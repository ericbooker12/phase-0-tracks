#9.3 jQuery - Release 0

##jQuery Plan
* Get an overview of jQuery on wikipedia
* Find jQuery docs and bookmark
* Find a couple of pieces of example code and try to make some sense of it
* Look for free downloadable resources online
* If time permits, order a book on Amazon (the best based on reviews) and get next day shipping
* Watch a couple of tutorials on jQuery and folow along
* Find some simple excersises and start writing code

##Effective Strategies
* The strategy I found most effective was to start with video tutorials, after getting a quick overview of the subject and learning how to install it, and expand from there. The best tutorial that I came across was "jQuery Essential Training" on lynda.com. Because of the time constraints I only got through about 30 to 45 minutes of the entire tutorial which was a great starting point. Also, I typically watch tutorials at 1.5x speed. I was able to take the concepts that were introduced and expand on them by using the jQuery API Documentation and W3Schools and lots of google searches.
