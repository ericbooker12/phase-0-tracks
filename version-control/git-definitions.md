# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
    Version control keeps track of changes made during software development. It's useful because it allows develpoers to go back to prior versions of their work if a mistake is made.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
    A branch creates a copy of the project so that you can make feature changes independently of the master copy. When the changes are satisfactory, they can be merged into the master copy.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
    When changes are made and added to the "staging area" they need to be commited to the project. Commit finalizes the changes/additions that were made in your branch. A good commit message is descriptive and meaningful. It should consisely describe what you did to the project before commiting.
* What is a merge conflict?
    
    A merge conflict will happen when 2 people try to change the same part of a project and the 2 branches are merged together.
