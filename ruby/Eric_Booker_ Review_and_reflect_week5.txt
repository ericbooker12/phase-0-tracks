1. Data structures are able to store multiple data that are connected to each other. They can be used to make sense of real life objects.

2. An array is a container that holds objects. You can access items in an array by their index.

3. An array might be used to store the names of objects found in a wallet.
	i.e. wallet_array = [cash, credit_cards, photos, gum]

4. A hash is a container that holds linked pairs (keys and values). Each key is linked to a value.

5. A hash can be used to store names of people and the typ of car they drive.
	i.e. peoples_cars {joe => truck, sally => a_red_one, fred => ford}

6. Iteration makes it easy to go through each item of an array or hash and apply an action to it.

7. Iteration would be useful if you wanted to paint all the cars red.
	i.e. for each car in the car array, paint it red.

8. A block is a piece of code that that has one or more parameters and an action that works on that parameter. They are usually used to iterate through a container.

9. A block parameter is a variable chosen at write time the represents the object in the current iteration.
