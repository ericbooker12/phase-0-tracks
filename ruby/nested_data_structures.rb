Design a data structure that lists several California breweries and the beers they brew.
1. Create a hash called california_breweries.
2. Add names of breweries to hash as keys.
3. Populate the keys with names of beers sold by the breweries.
	- names of beers will be in arrays.
4. Add a key with the name of the city of the brewery.
